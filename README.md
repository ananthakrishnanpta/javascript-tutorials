### 3. [Functions](03-00-functions.md)
Functions are one of the most important concepts in programming. This tutorial will explain how to define and call functions, as well as use parameters and return values.
- **[Built-in Functions](03-01-built-in-functions.md):** This section explains commonly used built-in JavaScript functions.
- **[User-Defined Functions (Advanced)](03-02-user-defined-funcs-advanced.md):** Learn how to create more complex user-defined functions and advanced concepts such as closures.

### 4. [JavaScript Objects](04-00-JS-Objects.md)
Learn how to work with JavaScript objects, including creating objects, accessing and modifying properties, and understanding object methods.
- **[Object Methods](04-01-JS-object-methods.md):** This section dives deeper into built-in object methods like `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, etc.
