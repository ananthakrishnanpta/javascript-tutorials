# **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript**
  ### Go back to [JavaScript Tutorial](README.md)

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, meaning it allows for several programming styles, including **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. OOP is a methodology that organizes software design around data, or **objects**, and the actions that can be performed on them, or **methods**.

### **Core Concepts of OOP**

1. **Objects**
2. **Classes**
3. **Encapsulation**
4. **Inheritance**
5. **Polymorphism**
6. **Abstraction**

We'll cover each concept in detail and provide coding examples and explanations.

### **1. Objects in JavaScript**

An **object** in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is a property name, and the value can be any valid JavaScript type, including other objects, arrays, and functions (methods).

#### **Creating Objects**

There are two primary ways to create objects in JavaScript: **object literal** and **Object constructor**.

**Object Literal Notation:**
```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
};
person.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
```

**Using Object Constructor:**
```javascript
const person = new Object();
person.name = "Bob";
person.age = 30;
person.greet = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};
person.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Bob
```

---

### **2. Classes in JavaScript**

A **class** is essentially a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties and methods shared by all instances of the class.

#### **Creating a Class**

In JavaScript, we define classes using the `class` keyword.

**Basic Class Syntax:**
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
person1.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
```

**Explanation:**
- **`constructor()`** is a special method that gets called when a new instance of the class is created. It initializes the object's properties.
- **`this`** refers to the current instance of the class.

---

### **3. Encapsulation in JavaScript**

**Encapsulation** is the concept of restricting access to certain properties or methods of an object, allowing you to control how an object's data is modified or accessed.

In JavaScript, **encapsulation** is achieved using **getter** and **setter** methods. These methods allow controlled access to private properties.

#### **Private Properties:**

JavaScript does not have native support for true **private** properties (like in some other languages such as Java or C++). However, **private properties** can be simulated using **closures** or naming conventions like an underscore `_`.

Here's how encapsulation works in JavaScript:

##### **Simulating Private Properties**

You can use an underscore (`_`) as a convention to denote private properties.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this._name = name;  // Simulated private property
    this._age = age;    // Simulated private property
  }

  // Getter for name
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  // Setter for name
  set name(newName) {
    this._name = newName;
  }

  // Getter for age
  get age() {
    return this._age;
  }

  // Setter for age
  set age(newAge) {
    if (newAge > 0) {
      this._age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log("Age must be positive.");
    }
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
console.log(person1.name);  // Output: Alice
person1.name = "Bob";       // Setter invoked
console.log(person1.name);  // Output: Bob
person1.age = -5;           // Output: Age must be positive.
```

In the example above:
- **`_name`** and **`_age`** are simulated private properties (they are not really private but treated as such by convention).
- **Getters and setters** are used to safely access and modify these properties.

#### **True Privacy with `#` Syntax (Private Fields)**

In recent versions of JavaScript (ECMAScript 2022), JavaScript now supports **true private fields** using the `#` syntax. Private fields can only be accessed within the class and not from outside.

```javascript
class Person {
  // Private fields
  #name;
  #age;

  constructor(name, age) {
    this.#name = name;
    this.#age = age;
  }

  // Getter for name
  get name() {
    return this.#name;
  }

  // Setter for name
  set name(newName) {
    this.#name = newName;
  }

  // Getter for age
  get age() {
    return this.#age;
  }

  // Setter for age
  set age(newAge) {
    if (newAge > 0) {
      this.#age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log("Age must be positive.");
    }
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
console.log(person1.name);  // Output: Alice
person1.name = "Bob";       // Setter invoked
console.log(person1.name);  // Output: Bob

// Accessing private field directly will cause an error
// console.log(person1.#name);  // SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

In this case:
- **`#name`** and **`#age`** are truly private fields. They cannot be accessed or modified from outside the class.

### **4. Inheritance in JavaScript**

**Inheritance** allows one class to inherit the properties and methods from another class. This is a key feature of OOP that allows you to build upon existing code.

In JavaScript, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword.

#### **Inheritance Example:**

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);  // Calls the parent class constructor
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");
dog.speak();  // Output: Buddy barks
```

**Explanation:**
- `Dog` inherits from `Animal` by using the `extends` keyword.
- **`super()`** is used to call the parent class's constructor.

---

### **5. Polymorphism in JavaScript**

**Polymorphism** allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently based on the object invoking them.

#### **Polymorphism Example:**

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Dog barks");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Cat meows");
  }
}

const animal = new Animal();
const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

animal.speak();  // Output: Animal makes a sound
dog.speak();     // Output: Dog barks
cat.speak();     // Output: Cat meows
```

**Explanation:**
- All classes (`Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat`) have the same method `speak()`, but the behavior of the method is different depending on the class from which it is called.

---

### **6. Abstraction in JavaScript**

**Abstraction** hides the complex implementation details and exposes only the essential parts of the object to the user. JavaScript doesn't support **abstract classes** like some other languages, but you can still achieve abstraction through **method overriding** and by throwing errors in abstract methods.

#### **Abstraction Example:**

```javascript
class Shape {
  constructor() {
    if (this.constructor === Shape) {
      throw new Error("Cannot instantiate an abstract class");
    }
  }

  // Abstract method
  area() {
    throw new Error("Method 'area' must be implemented in subclass");
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(radius) {
    super();  // Call the parent class constructor
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  area() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

const circle = new Circle(5);
console.log(circle.area());  // Output: 78.5398 (approx)

// Uncommenting the following line would cause an error
// const shape = new Shape();  // Error: Cannot instantiate an abstract class
```

**Explanation:**
- The `Shape` class is abstract because it throws an error if you attempt to instantiate it.
- The method `area()` is also abstract and must be implemented in subclasses like `Circle`.

### **7. Closures in JavaScript**

A **closure** is a function that "remembers" the environment in which it was created, even when that function is executed outside of its original scope. Closures allow functions to access variables from their outer scope, even after that outer scope has finished executing.

#### **Understanding Closures:**

Closures are created when a function is defined inside another function and the inner function retains access to variables of the outer function.

**Closure Example:**

```javascript
function outer() {
  let counter = 0;  // Outer function's local variable

  function inner() {
    counter++;  // The inner function can access and modify the outer function's variable
    console.log(counter);
  }

  return inner;  // The inner function is returned, forming a closure
}

const increment = outer();  // Call outer(), which returns inner()
increment();  // Output: 1
increment();  // Output: 2
increment();  // Output: 3
```

**Explanation:**
- The `inner()` function is a closure because it has access to the `counter` variable from its outer scope (`outer()`).
- Even though the `outer()` function has finished executing, `inner()` continues to access the `counter` variable.

1. **Objects**: Store data and methods. They are the most fundamental unit in OOP.
2. **Classes**: Provide a blueprint for creating objects.
3. **Encapsulation**: Involves hiding internal object data and providing methods for controlled access.
4. **Inheritance**: Allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.
5. **Polymorphism**: Allows multiple classes to implement the same method but with different behavior.
6. **Abstraction**: Hides complex details and exposes only essential functionality.
7. **Closures**: Functions that remember the environment in which they were created and can access variables from outer scopes.
